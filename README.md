## What was done
Within three hours
1. Connect to mapbox API using key
2. Update Loading component with Loader svg
3. Create Sidebar navigation with Projects and Sites data. Note: without onClickSubitem event

Extra time
1. As preparation I watched 1.5 hour video to understand Redux
2. I understood architecture and file structure of App with Redux
3. Built Chart. I wanted to make it, because I have never done something like that before, so I updated Chart with Graph component. I could not get data, so I created static data in State to be able to show chart.

### Module added
1. react-icons for icons
2. uuid for dynamic id's

#### Summary
It was interesting experience to understand the architecture of App with Redux and great opportunity to start learning Redux with real exercise.
